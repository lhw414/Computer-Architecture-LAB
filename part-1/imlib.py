CSAP RAW image format specification

The CSAP RAW image format contains raw uncompressed pixel data. The data is 


  MAGIC   4 characters 'C', 'S', 'A', 'P'.
  FORMAT  integer, big endian. Valid values: BGR_FORMAT (3 channels) or BGRA_FORMAT (4 channels).
  Height  integer, little endian. Specifices the height of the image.
  Width   integer, little endian. Specifices the width of the image.
  Data    image data stored as multi-dimensional array, row-major.
